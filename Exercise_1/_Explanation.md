# Exercise 1

This exercise covers the basic HTML tags and their usage. Below is an explanation of the various HTML tags used in this exercise.

## HTML Tags Explained

### <!DOCTYPE html>
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document. It must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.

### <html>
The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements must be inside this tag.

### <head>
The `<head>` element is a container for meta-information about the HTML document. It can include tags like `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<style>`, and `<script>`.

### <title>
The `<title>` tag defines the title of the document. This title is displayed on the browser's title bar or tab.

### <body>
The `<body>` tag defines the document's body. It contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

### <h1> to <h6>
The `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags are used to define HTML headings. `<h1>` defines the most important heading, while `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

### <p>
The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each `<p>` element.

### <a>
The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

### <img>
The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed.

### <ul>, <ol>, and <li>
- The `<ul>` tag defines an unordered list.
- The `<ol>` tag defines an ordered list.
- The `<li>` tag defines a list item. Both unordered and ordered lists use the `<li>` tag to list items.

### <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>
- The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.
- The `<tr>` tag defines a table row.
- The `<th>` tag defines a header cell in a table.
- The `<td>` tag defines a standard data cell in a table.

### <div>
The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.

### <span>
The `<span>` tag is used to group inline-elements in a document. It provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.
