# Exercise 2

This exercise covers the creation and usage of HTML forms and media elements. Below is an explanation of the various HTML tags used in this exercise.

## HTML Tags Explained

### Form Elements

#### <form>
The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input. The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data when it is submitted, and the `method` attribute specifies how to send the form data.

#### <input>
The `<input>` tag is used to create various types of user input fields, such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more. The `type` attribute specifies the type of input field to display.

#### <label>
The `<label>` tag defines a label for an `<input>` element. It improves the usability and accessibility of web forms by linking the text label to the corresponding input field.

#### <textarea>
The `<textarea>` tag is used to create a multi-line text input field. This is useful for collecting large amounts of text from the user.

#### <select> and <option>
The `<select>` tag is used to create a drop-down list. The `<option>` tag is used within the `<select>` tag to define the available options in the drop-down list.

#### <button>
The `<button>` tag defines a clickable button. It can contain text or images and can be used in forms or anywhere in a document where a button is needed.

### Media Elements

#### <img>
The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed.

#### <audio>
The `<audio>` tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams. The `controls` attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

#### <video>
The `<video>` tag is used to embed video content in a document. The `controls` attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
